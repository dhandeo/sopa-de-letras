Wordsearch generator
====================

Currently, this is a simple command-line script which generates a wordsearch
grid.

Usage:

 python wordsearch.py <difficulty> [word...]

The grid size, and permissible directions for words, is controlled by the
difficulty setting, which is one of easy, normal and hard.

The output grid is displayed on stdout, and written to a pdf file.

Much work still remains to make the output nice.

Requirements
============

reportlab Python library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab)
